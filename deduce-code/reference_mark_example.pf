theorem mark_example: all x:Nat. if x = 1 then x + x + x = 3
proof
  arbitrary x:Nat
  suppose: x = 1
  equations
    #x# + x + x = 1 + x + x   by rewrite recall x = 1
  $ 1 + #x# + x = 1 + 1 + x   by rewrite recall x = 1
  $ 1 + 1 + #x# = 1 + 1 + 1   by rewrite recall x = 1
            ... = 3           by definition {operator+,operator+}
