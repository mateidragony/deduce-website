theorem intro_addition_of_evens:
  all x:Nat, y:Nat.
  if Even(x) and Even(y) then Even(x + y)
proof
  arbitrary x:Nat, y:Nat
  suppose even_xy: Even(x) and Even(y)
  have even_x: some m:Nat. x = 2 * m by definition Even in even_xy
  have even_y: some m:Nat. y = 2 * m by definition Even in even_xy
  obtain a where x_2a: x = 2*a from even_x
  obtain b where y_2b: y = 2*b from even_y
  suffices some m:Nat. x + y = 2 * m  by definition Even
  choose a + b
  suffices 2 * a + 2 * b = 2 * (a + b)  by rewrite x_2a | y_2b
