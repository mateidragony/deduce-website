theorem list_append_empty: all U :type. all xs :List<U>.
  xs ++ [] = xs
proof
  arbitrary U:type
  induction List<U>
  case empty {
    conclude @[]<U> ++ [] = []  by definition operator++
  }
  case node(n, xs') suppose IH: xs' ++ [] = xs' {
    equations
      node(n,xs') ++ []
          = node(n, xs' ++ [])   by definition operator++
      ... = node(n,xs')             by rewrite IH
  }
