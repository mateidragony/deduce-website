theorem apply_to_example: all P:bool, Q:bool, R:bool.
  if (if P then Q) and (if Q then R) and P
  then R
proof
  arbitrary P:bool, Q:bool, R:bool
  suppose prem: (if P then Q) and (if Q then R) and P
  have pq: if P then Q  by prem
  have p: P             by prem
  have q: Q             by apply pq to p
  have qr: if Q then R  by prem
  conclude R            by apply qr to q
